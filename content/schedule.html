            <p>This is the schedule for BarCamp Charlotte 4, Oct 9th at Area Fifteen.</p>

            <h2>Saturday Oct 9th, 2010</h2>
            
            <p><span>8.00am</span> - Door open / Coffee and Pastries<br/> This is a chance to get into Area 15 and get a coffee and meet some of your fellow Barcampers. You can polish your pitch and prepare yourself for voting.</p>

            <p><span>9.00am</span> - Start of the event – pitches and voting</p>

            <p><span>10.00am-11.00am</span> - First Sessions <br/>Those pitches that were voted through will get a session room and we’ll be assigning these and then updating everyone. This hour will be for the first sessions.</p>

            <p><span>11.15am-12.15pm</span> - Second Sessions<br/> After 15 mins to switch rooms this hour will be for the second session.</p>

            <p><span>12.30pm – 2.00pm</span> – Lunch<br/> We will be setting up a trailer outside Area Fifteen for a cookout, hopefully all the food will be free (and we’ll be thanking the sponsors!).</p>

            <p class="hidden"><span>2pm-2.30pm</span> - Resume<br/> We want to use the power of the people at Barcamp for good in Charlotte and beyond. To that end we want to give the floor to Charities looking to connect with people in the technology, social media and creative space. In this section of the day – you’ll hear from Charities and have a chance to get connected and help.</p>

            <p><span>2.35pm – 3pm</span> – Pitches and Votes for Second Half of the Day<br/> Much like the morning we’ll be taking pitches (or re-pitches) for the third, fourth, and fifth sessions.</p>

            <p><span>3pm-4pm</span> – Third Sessions</p>

            <p><span>4.10pm-5.10pm</span> – Fourth Sessions</p>

            <p><span>5.20pm-6.20pm</span> – Fifth Sessions</p>

            <p><span>7pm – 8pm</span> – BarCamp Bar Crawl</p>
