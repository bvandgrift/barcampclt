            %b Morning Pitches &amp Voting for Sessions
            .details Here at BarCamp Charlotte we keep things pretty democratic. You decide what each session is about. Those that want to pitch a topic, an idea or a conversation have <b>30 seconds</b> to pitch to the crowd and convince your fellow BarCampers that your session will melt their faces off. Once all the pitches have been made the BarCampers will vote and the top pitches will be assigned sessions.
