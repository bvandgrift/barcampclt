            .details Here at BarCamp Charlotte we keep things pretty democratic. You decide what each session is about. Those that want to pitch a topic, an idea or a conversation have <b>30 seconds</b> to pitch to the crowd and convince your fellow BarCampers that your session will melt their faces off. Once all the pitches have been made the BarCampers will vote and the top pitches will be assigned sessions.

            .details It it's your first time at BarCamp Charlotte then you should probably have a pretty good idea how the whole pitching &amp; voting thing works. After lunch we'll do a second round of pitches. If you weren't quite feeling it in the morning or your pitch didn't get the votes then go ahead a pitch for one of the afternoon sessions.
