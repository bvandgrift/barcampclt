            <p>BarCamp Charlotte runs on the energy of its volunteers and sponsors. Without both, BarCamp Charlotte as you know it wouldn't happen (well..it might, but not nearly as fun).</p>

            <h2>Volunteers have the opportunity to:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to plan, manage, and coordinate an event</li>
                <li>Network with the brainstormers and innovators of Charlotte</li>
                <li>Gain school credit for working for an event</li>
                <li>Have a fun time making a BarCamp happen!</li>
            </ul>
