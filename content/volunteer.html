                <p>BarCamp Charlotte runs on the energy of its volunteers and sponsors. Without both, BarCamp Charlotte as you know it wouldn't happen (well..it might, but not nearly as fun). <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/lv?key=0An3AlybC12cidGgxV2hrT0t3TFVheFh0aU1hSlg4T2c&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow">Help us out and volunteer</a>.</p>

                    <li>Learn how to plan, manage, and coordinate an event</li>
                    <li>Network with the brainstormers and innovators of Charlotte</li>
                    <li>Gain school credit for working for an event</li>
                    <li>Have a fun time making a BarCamp happen!</li>

                <h3>Venue Prep</h3>
                <p>We need a group of people to help us prepare Area 15 for BarCamp the day before the event. Things like setting up chairs and tables, hanging signs, etc.</p>
                
                <h3>Tech Prep</h3>
                <p>We need another group of people to help us setup the BarCamp network, including wireless modems, routers, power, video cameras, microphones, projectors, monitors, etc.</p>

                <h2>Day Of</h2>
                
                <h3>Room Coordinators</h3>
                <p>Help needed during session switches to make sure everyone knows where they're going, and during sessions to make sure each room and presenter has the materials/tools they need. It would be ideal to get enough people helping here so everyone can switch out during the day so each person only has to commit to 1 or 2 sessions.</p>
                
                <h3>Food Support</h3>
                <p>We need a few people to help make sure the food arrives and is setup for hungry BarCampers</p>
                
                <h3>Tech Support</h3>
                <p>We need a handful of people the day of that can be on call if tech complications arise -- i.e., projectors not working, wifi networks going down, etc. Leave your Twitter name or cell phone numbers so we can summon during the event if needed.</p>
