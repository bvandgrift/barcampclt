    %h2 What is BarCamp, you ask?
    %p BarCamp is Charlotte’s one and only un-conference, an event where professionals from all industries come and pitch to talk about a topic they love, and people vote on what they would like to learn about. Its mission: to provide a space for professionals to get together and exchange ideas.
    %h2 Who attends this madness?
    %p BarCamp brings out the best and brightest in the technology, startup, tech, media, investing, marketing and computer industries. From freelancers to entrepreneurs, to executives and college students, BarCamp reaches them all!
    %h2 What’s in it for me?
    %p BarCamp is all volunteer and free for attendees, and that’s why sponsors make BarCamp Charlotte special. And BarCamp Charlotte needs your help again. To bring even more value to the sponsorship levels, we added a few more benefits...behold:
